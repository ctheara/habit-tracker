**Notes:**

- `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` is only needed if your backend is not running on `http://localhost:5000` during local development. For production, set it to your deployed backend URL.
- You may add other environment variables as needed for email, third-party integrations, etc.
- You can use either `DATABASE_URL` or the individual `PGHOST`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD` variables for PostgreSQL connection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL

### Backend Setup

1. `cd backend`
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file (see `.env.example` if available):
   - `PORT=5000`
   - `JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret`
   - ...
4. Run database migrations (if any):
   ```bash
   # Example using a migration tool or psql
   # psql -U user -d dbname -f src/db/migrations/create_user_habit_tables.sql
   ```
5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. `cd frontend`
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file with your backend API URL (optional for local run):
   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
   ```
4. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## API & Authentication

- The backend issues a JWT token as an **httpOnly, secure cookie** (`authToken`) after login/signup.
- The frontend does **not** store the token in localStorage/sessionStorage; it relies on the cookie for authentication.
- All API requests requiring authentication must be sent with `withCredentials: true`.
- The backend sets cookies with:
  - `httpOnly: true`
  - `secure: true` (requires HTTPS)
  - `sameSite: "None"` (for cross-site cookies)
- When logging out, the backend clears the cookie with the same options.

---

## Deployment Notes

- **CORS:** The backend only allows requests from specific origins (see `allowedOrigins` in backend `index.ts`). Update this list to match your deployed frontend URL exactly (including protocol and subdomain).
- **HTTPS:** Both frontend and backend must be served over HTTPS for cookies to work with `secure: true` and `sameSite: "None"`.
- **Frontend Hosting:** Vercel, Netlify, or similar
- **Backend Hosting:** Render, Heroku, Railway, or similar

- **Habit Management**
  - Create, complete, update, delete habits
- **Notification and Reminders**
